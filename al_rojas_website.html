<font size="+2"> <h1>Welcome to my first-ever website! </h1> </font>
<font size="+2"> <p>First, I would like to introduce myself, my full name is Alvaro Ignacio Rojas and I am a first-year computer science student
studying at Weber State University. <br> I have served in the Air Force for 6 Years as a Medical Technician and I have since then separated the military 
at the rank of Staff Sergeant. <br> I had a very prominent future in the medical field but Extra Duties, long hospital hours, and
quality of work made me reconsider career fields. <br> Despite deciding to change careers, I am still eternally grateful for all the 
experiences and people I got to meet during my time in the service. <br> Here's a table of some of the places I've been to.  
</p> </font>


<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Base</th>
    <th>Time</th>
    <th>Country</th>

  <tr>
    <td>Lackland Air Force Base</td>
    <td>2 Months</td>
    <td>Texas, USA</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Kadena Air Force Base</td>
    <td>1 year, 10 Months</td>
    <td>Kadena, Japan</td>

    <td>Eglin Air Force Base</td>
    <td>4 Years</td>
    <td>Florida, USA</td>

<font size="+2"> <p2> <br> While deciding what the next steps were, I had a roommate who was currently working as a software engineer. <br> He introduced me to
the tech world and encouraged me to give it a try. <br> After much research and a few free coding classes online, such as <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/"> Codecademy.com</a> and <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/"> Freecodecamp.com</a> <br> I decided this was a career that I would enjoy as I have always loved electronics and video games being one of my greatest pass times. <br>
So my journey begins. <p2> </font>
